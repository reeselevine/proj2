We propose a 3D first-person maze game. The maze will be generated using a random path-finding algorithm
such as Kruskal’s or Prim’s algorithm, and the difficulty level will increase as the player completes mazes.
The camera will be controlled by a combination of accelerometer and touch controls. Since mazes can get
complicated really fast, we aim to increase player attention span by putting obstacles at dead ends, so that
players don’t have to always retrace their steps. For example, we can ask a question, which could be a riddle,
programming question, or some other genre, and if the player gets the question right, the wall will open and
reveal a way through the dead end. If the player gets the question wrong, an enemy could potentially show up
which the player has to kill before being allowed to proceed.

The walls will be shaded using a texture, possibly stone or psychedelic. The maze will be open at the top,
and we plan to render a sky to make the world look more realistic. Since our maze will be “outside”, our custom
shader can simulate an advanced lighting technique. There will be a beacon of light over the exit of the maze,
giving a player some idea of what direction they need to proceed.
